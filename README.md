### üìÑ **Description**

**Flow Puzzle Game** is a browser-based logic puzzle where players connect matching colored dots on a grid without crossing paths. The goal is to fill the entire grid with colored lines.  
Inspired by the popular mobile puzzle game **Flow Free**, this project was created as a fun and interactive JavaScript learning exercise to explore DOM manipulation, game logic, and visual feedback in web development.

This project helps sharpen problem-solving skills and demonstrates how to build dynamic user interfaces using **vanilla JavaScript**. It can be used for educational purposes or enhanced further into a full-scale puzzle game.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**

- **HTML5**
  - Grid structure
  - Semantic layout
- **CSS3**
  - Flex and Grid layout systems
  - Color-coding and animations
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**
  - DOM manipulation
  - Event handling
  - Game state logic and user interaction

### üöÄ **Getting Started**

This section outlines how the Flow Puzzle Game project was initiated and the key decisions made early on:

1. **Conceptualization & Wireframing**

   - Sketched the layout and game interface using hand-drawn wireframes.
   - Defined core gameplay mechanics (connecting color-matched dots without overlapping paths).

2. **Setting Up the Project**

   - Created basic file structure: `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js`.
   - Set up a 2D grid using HTML and styled it with CSS Grid for visual clarity.

3. **Game Logic Design**

   - Planned the logic to:
     - Handle user input (clicks on cells).
     - Track and validate the current path.
     - Ensure paths do not overlap.
     - Check for level completion.

4. **Initial Coding**

   - Coded dynamic grid generation using JavaScript.
   - Handled basic user interaction: selecting a dot, drawing paths, and completing connections.

5. **Interface Enhancements**
   - Added color-coded paths, animations, and feedback when a level is completed.
   - Implemented control buttons: **UNDO**, **RESET**, and **NEXT LEVEL**.

These early stages built the foundation of a playable and visually interactive puzzle game.
