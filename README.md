### 📄 **Description**

**Flow Puzzle Game** is a browser-based logic puzzle where players connect matching colored dots on a grid without crossing paths. The goal is to fill the entire grid with colored lines.  
Inspired by the popular mobile puzzle game **Flow Free**, this project was created as a fun and interactive JavaScript learning exercise to explore DOM manipulation, game logic, and visual feedback in web development.

This project helps sharpen problem-solving skills and demonstrates how to build dynamic user interfaces using **vanilla JavaScript**. It can be used for educational purposes or enhanced further into a full-scale puzzle game.
